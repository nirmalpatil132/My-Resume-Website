👋 Hello! This is Nirmal Patil's Personal Portfolio
Welcome to the code behind my personal portfolio website! 🚀 This isn't just a webpage; it's a modern, single-page application I built to showcase my skills and journey as a Front-End Developer & Agentic AI Engineer.

✨ Live Demo: nirmalpatil132.github.io
🎯 About This Project
I built this portfolio from the ground up to be a dynamic and visually engaging representation of my capabilities. It's my central hub on the web, designed to give visitors, potential employers, and collaborators an interactive experience. The design is based on a clean, dark-themed aesthetic inspired by modern web trends.

Key Features Include:

📱 Fully Responsive Design: Looks and works perfectly on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

💨 Smooth Scroll Animations: Using the ScrollReveal.js library, elements animate into view for a smooth, dynamic feel.

✍️ Dynamic Typing Effect: An animated typing effect on the home page cycles through my key roles, powered by Typed.js.

🔎 Interactive Project Filtering: Users can easily filter the projects section by category (All, Agentic AI, Web Development).

📧 Functional Contact Form: The "Get In Touch" form is fully functional using Formspree to deliver messages directly to my inbox.

📄 Click-to-Download CV: A dedicated button allows visitors to download my resume with a single click.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
This website was brought to life using a combination of core web technologies and modern libraries:
